MW3Guard 1.4.2 (Release)
========================

This program should help PlayStation(r) 3 users to extend their experience with Modern Warfare(r) 3 from Activision.
Activision / IW had stopped patching their game in order to force us to buy their newest licence.  Matter of business!
We ain't fooled, that why I decided to develop this software. I don't want their newest game, I don't want to buy the new console. 
I think that Modern Warfare(r) licence began to die since the 3rd opus. (My opinion)

MW3Guard is (most likely) the first mod. to secure your ingame session.
This is only for PlayStation(r) 3 with CFW and CCAPI.

This project was a opportunity for me to learn about C# and of course to play without cheaters.
